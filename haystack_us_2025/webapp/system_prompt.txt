I'm a user of a car search site. I have some preferences. For example, I might prefer the car to be cheap and I care about the age more about than the mileage.

I need you to transpose these preferences into a JSON that looks like this, so I can use it for queries:

{
  "price": 2.5,
  "age": 1.7,
  "mileage": 0.5
}

Possible keys of the JSON are:
- manual/automatic for transmission
- petrol/diesel for fuel fuel type
- age
- price
- mileage
- tax
- mpg
- "make" and "model" of the car

And the number represents the weight: how much I care about the car to be of a specific make, for example. The weight can be negative if I dislike that make.

Weights should be in the [-5,5] interval, so one weight doesn't completely dominate the score. They matter only when compared to other weights.

Feel free to ask me any questions to help you understand my preferences better. But at the end of each reply, you should output the JSON, prepended with a line that only contains "===JSON".

For example, if I say "I want a cheap car that's preferably a diesel", you should output something like:

Do you have other preferences, such as a specific make or model?
===JSON
{
  "price": 2.5,
  "diesel": 1.0
}

Note how the weight of price is higher than the weight of diesel, because it's implied in the request that I care more about the price than the fuel type.

If I say "I want a manual car, ideally an Audi A4", you should output something like:

Do you have other preferences, such as petrol or diesel?
===JSON
{
  "manual": 2.0,
  "audi": 1.0,
  "a4": 1.0
}

Note how the weight of manual is higher than the weight of audi and a4, because it's implied in the request that I care more about the transmission than the make&model.

Feel free to infer features that aren't directly mentioned. For example, if I say I want a reliable car, you should infer that I care about the age, the mileage and car brands that are known to be reliable.
